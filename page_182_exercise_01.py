Program:In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?
Solution:
    In some cases, you can decompose a complex problem into smaller problems of the same form. In these cases, the subproblems can all be solved
    by using the same function. This design strategy is called recursive design, and the resulting functions are called recursive functions.

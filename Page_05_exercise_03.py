Problem:
    Write an algorithm that describes a common task, such as baking a cake or operating a DVD player.
Solution:
     Each individual instruction in an algorithm is well defined. This means that the
    action described by the instruction can be performed effectively or be executed
    by a computing agent. For example, any computing agent capable of arithmetic can
    compute the difference between two digits. So an algorithmic step that says “compute the difference between two digits” would be well defined. On the other hand,
    a step that says “divide a number by 0” is not well defined, because no computing
    agent could carry it out.

Problem:
   Jack says that he will not bother with analysis and design but proceed directly to
   coding his programs. Why is that not a good idea?
Solution:
    Although the diagram depicts distinct phases, this does not mean that developers must
analyze and design a complete system before coding it. Modern software development
is usually incremental and iterative. This means that analysis and design may produce a
rough draft, skeletal version, or prototype of a system for coding, and then back up to ear-lier phases to fill in more details after some testing. For purposes of introducing this pro-cess, however, we treat these phases as distinct.
Programs rarely work as hoped the first time they are run; hence, they should be subjected
to extensive and careful testing. Many people think that testing is an activity that applies
only to the implementation and integration phases; however, you should scrutinize the

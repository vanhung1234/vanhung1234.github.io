Problem:
    The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the formula KE 1 2/ mv 5 2 ( )
    where m is the object’s mass and v is its velocity. Modify the program you created
    in Project 5 so that it prints the object’s kinetic energy as well as its momentum.
Solution:

"""
# Request the input
mass = float(input("Enter the object's mass:"))
velocity = float(input("Enter the object's velocity:"))

# Compute the results
momentum = mass * velocity
kineticEnergy = (mass * velocity ** 2) / 2

# Display the results
print("The object's momentum is", momentum)
print("The object's kinetic Energy is", kineticEnergy)

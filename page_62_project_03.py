Problem:
    Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who
    like to buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and
    oldies for $2.00 a night. Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video
    can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program
    should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total
    cost.
Solution:

"""
# Initialize constants
NEW_RENTAL = 3.00
OLDIE_RENTAL = 2.00

# Request the inputs
newOnes = int(input("Enter the number of new videos: "))
oldOnes = int(input("Enter the number of oldies: "))

# Compute the results
totalCost = NEW_RENTAL * newOnes + OLDIE_RENTAL * oldOnes

# Display the results
print("The total cost is $" + str(round(totalCost, 2)))

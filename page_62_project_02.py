Problem:
    You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge.
    Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints
    the cubeâ€™s surface area as output.
Solution:

"""
# Request the input
edge = float(input("enter the cube's edge: "))

# Compute the surface erea
surfaceArea = edge * edge * 6

# Display the surface area
print("The surface area is", surfaceArea, "square units.")
